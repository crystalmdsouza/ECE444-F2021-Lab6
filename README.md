Pros of TDD: Test-driven development is beneficial because:
- Since testing code is easier with a set of unit tests, developers run tests on their code more frequently and catch bugs sooner after they arise.
- Designs will be well-partitioned and modular, since writing tests for your code forces the developers to make it modular.
- The code will be written more clearly if it is written with specific tests in mind during development. Thus, restructuring it at a later date will be easier.
- When working on a team, colleagues will be more trusting of code that has already been tested rigorously.

Cons of TDD: Test-driven development may not be beneficial because:
- Writing unit tests can slow down progress at the beginning of development since more effort will be spent creating the test suite itself.
- If the unit tests are not clean enough, they could malfunction themselves and require additional debugging.
- If code has already been written before the tests are created, it may less modular and thus more difficult to develop tests for.
